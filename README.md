# Trello-Extractor
This is a tiny app that provides some QoL improvements exporting from Trello (Jira equivalent). This app was used by a worker during my summer internship to make filtering an easier task for him.

The app takes an input csv file and filters through 'List Name' (can be changed in the code). The output csv file will contain only those rows left after filteration.
